# Random Walker

In this exercise I have created a cell that randomly steps up, down, left or right each frame. The background is not refreshed each frame so the trail of the cell is visible. I am using the random() function in p5 which is a form of uniform distribution - this means that the random value given is remembered and effects the following random value given.
